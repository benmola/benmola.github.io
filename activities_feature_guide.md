# ✅ Activities Feature Added!

I've successfully added **Activities** support to your CV automation system! Here's everything you need to know:

## 🎯 What's New

### **Activities Section**
- 📊 **Conferences** and symposiums
- 🛠️ **Workshops** and training sessions  
- 🎤 **Presentations** and talks
- 🏫 **Summer/Spring schools**
- 💻 **Webinars** and online events
- 📋 **Seminars** and meetings

### **Full Control**
- ✅ **Website**: Always shows all activities from JSON
- ⚙️ **CV**: Only shows activities if enabled in config
- 🔢 **Filtering**: Can limit by type, number, etc.

## 📋 How It Works

### **1. Data Storage** (`cv-data.json`)
Activities are stored with this structure:
```json
{
  "date": "6-9 July 2025",
  "event": "Conference Name",
  "location": "City, Country",
  "type": "conference",
  "description": "Full description of what you did"
}
```

### **2. CV Control** (`cv-config.json`)
```json
{
  "cv_sections": {
    "activities": false    ← Disabled by default (keeps CV short)
  },
  "cv_settings": {
    "max_activities": 10,  ← Limit number if enabled
    "activities_type_filter": "conference"  ← Show only specific types
  }
}
```

### **3. Website Display**
Activities automatically appear on your skills page with:
- 📅 Smart date formatting
- 🏷️ Activity type icons
- 📍 Location information
- 📝 Full descriptions

## 🚀 Getting Started

### **Option 1: Use Pre-filled Data**
I've already included all 17 of your activities in the updated `cv-data.json`. Just copy it over!

### **Option 2: Extract from Your HTML**
```bash
python extract_activities.py
```
This will automatically extract activities from your existing `skills.html`.

### **Option 3: Manual Entry**
Add activities directly to your `cv-data.json` file.
