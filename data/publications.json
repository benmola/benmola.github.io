            "abstract": "Anaerobic digestion (AD) is a renewable energy technology for energy recovery via biogas production, providing a route for a circular economy via waste valorisation. Currently, AD systems are largely operated conservatively based on experience from operators, due to the challenges behind predicting system responses to changing feedstocks. This study leverages insights and reflections from a workshop with industry professionals on the necessity for more reliable decision-making tools to assist operators and examines the incorporation of advanced methods for real-time decision-support for AD systems.",

This study compares mechanistic and data-driven models for biogas prediction using lab-scale data. A state estimation framework with Haldane kinetics achieved R² = 0.91, while a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model with Bayesian Optimisation showed superior performance (R² = 0.93–0.98). The LSTM model was further applied to industrial data, maintaining high accuracy (R² = 0.95–0.97) and demonstrating its scalability.",

            "abstract": "This study introduces the novel application of a Multi-Task Gaussian Process (MTGP) model to predict biogas production and critical anaerobic digestion (AD) performance indicators (soluble COD, volatile fatty acids (VFAs)), addressing feedstock variability and dynamic process behavior. We compare the MTGP against the widely used mechanistic AM2 model to evaluate its accuracy and applicability for probabilistic modeling in AD systems. The MTGP framework leverages multi-output correlations and uncertainty quantification, trained on experimental data, achieving superior predictive performance over AM2in this study, with lower RMSE (SCOD: 0.32 g/L; VFAs: 0.87 mmol/L; biogas: 0.15 L/day) and higher R² values (SCOD:0.91, VFAs:0.94, biogas :0.88) under the conditions tested. While AM2 provides biochemical insights, its reliance on unvalidated assumptions may limits robustness. The flexibility of MTGP and precision suggest its potential for real-world applications such as Bayesian Optimization and Design of Experiments, enabling data-driven process enhancement without mechanistic constraints. This work establishes MTGP as a pioneering tool for AD optimization, bridging data-driven efficiency with practical bioenergy challenges.",

            "abstract": "This research delves into the realms of data-driven modeling, order reduction, and control strategies within the context of Anaerobic Digestion (AD) processes. The study is centered on addressing pivotal challenges in this domain and delivering innovative contributions to the field. The primary objectives encompass streamlining the complexity of the Anaerobic Digestion Model No.1 (ADM1) for the specific purpose of control, as well as the exploration of suitable data-driven techniques to achieve precise modeling and prediction of AD systems. Furthermore, the research endeavors to extract kinetics reactions from simulated time-series AD data, develop robust predictive models for Chemostat dynamics under both Monod and Haldane kinetics through data-driven methodologies, and employ the Koopman Operator theory to enable data-driven modeling and control of the Chemostat system, relying solely on substrate measurements. By adopting a data-driven approach, this research aims to provide profound insights into the intricacies of AD processes, thereby shedding light on their complex dynamics and advancing our comprehension beyond conventional models. It introduces an alternative modeling perspective exclusively grounded in data, augmenting our analytical capabilities within the realm of AD processes. The research rigorously evaluates and tests a variety of data-driven techniques, yielding intriguing results. Notably, the application of the Koopman Operator theory represents a significant contribution, particularly in scenarios where measurement resources are limited. This innovation holds the potential to pave the way for robust control strategies within AD systems, ultimately enhancing their sustainability and efficiency.",

            "abstract": "The chemostat is widely used as a laboratory pilot for bioprocess studies. Chemostat models are nonlinear and rarely used in modern control experiments. For a data-driven control strategy, we use the Koopman operator approach to derive a linear model for a simple chemostat with one substrate and one biomass, using only the chemostat's input-output data. For chemostat control, we use the linear Koopman model to develop a MPC controller. The linear Koopman model best fits chemostat data compared to the local linearization-based model. In addition, the MPC based on the Koopman model gives very satisfying results compard with a linear MPC controller when applied to control the chemostat. The results are gained for a large space of initial conditions when chemostat control is usually limited.",

This study presents a dynamic model tailored for a lab-scale anaerobic digester operating on HTC products, specifically hydrochar and HTC liquor derived from sewage and agro-industrial digestate. Leveraging a modified version of the Anaerobic Model 2 (AM2), our simplified model of four states integrates pH and biomass decay rates into biomass kinetics. Simulation results of the mode were compared with experimental data collected over 164 days from the digester. The obtained results have proven the ability of the proposed model to predict the trend of the biogas production as well as important measured outputs of the bioreactor. The developed model could be used to control and optimize the performance of the digester, which provides potential for bioenergy production from waste streams such as digestate and digestate treated through the HTC process.",

The paper employs the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) algorithm, a popular and versatile method used for discovering nonlinear dynamical system models from data. The SINDy-PI (parallel, implicit) framework, a robust variation of the SINDy method, is used to find the implicit dynamics and rational nonlinearities of the CSTR for both Monod and Haldane types of specific growth rates. The simulation results demonstrate the accuracy of the method in inferring the ODEs of the CSTRs using limited and noisy data. The proposed method can be used to improve our understanding of complex systems and inform the design of control strategies.",

We construct a data-driven model (predictor) based on the Koopman operator theory, which can predict the future state of the nonlinear dynamical system of the chemostat by only measuring the input and output of the system. We are presenting a predictor with a linear structure, that can be used for diagnostics, state estimation and future state prediction and control of nonlinear chemostat. Importantly, the method of generating such linear predictors is entirely data-driven and extremely simple, leading to nonlinear data transformation (embedding), and a linear least squares problem in the embedded space which can be readily solved for large data sets. We show in simulations that Koopman approach best predicts the system trajectories compared to a local linearization methods.",

However, the ADM1 model is not dedicated for control purposes, due to its high dimension with 35 state variables. Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) technique was applied to reduce the ADM1 order, using data generated from the Benchmark Simulation Model No. 2 (BSM2). The method allows to obtain a global linear model with only 7 state variables, which are coherent with dominant dynamics of the ADM1. We show in simulation that we can reconstruct original state variables of ADM1 model.",
